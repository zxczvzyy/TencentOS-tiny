# Introduction to TencentOS Tiny

[TencentOS tiny](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/tos-tiny) is a real-time operating system developed by Tencent for the Internet of Things. It features low power consumption, low resource consumption, modularity, security and reliability, and can effectively improve the development efficiency of IoT terminal products. TencentOS tiny provides a streamlined RTOS core that can be tailored and configurable for rapid migration to a wide range of mainstream MCUs (such as the full range of STM32) and module chips. Moreover, based on the RTOS kernel, it provides a wealth of IoT components, and internally integrates mainstream IoT protocol stacks (such as CoAP/MQTT/TLS/DTLS/LoRaWAN/NB-IoT, etc.), which can help IoT terminals and services to quickly access Tencent. Cloud Internet of Things platform.


## 1、The software architecture of TencentOS tiny

![](./doc/image/introduction/TencentOS_tiny_Architecture_en.png)

TencentOS tiny main architecture diagram, from bottom to top, mainly includes:

**CPU libs** ：The CPU IP core architecture supported by TencentOS tiny,currently supports ARM Cortex M0/3/4/7.

**Drive management** ：Including board support package (BSP, mainly developed and maintained by MCU chip manufacturers), hardware abstraction (HAL, mainly provided by TencentOS tiny, to facilitate adaptation and porting of different chips), device drivers (Drivers, such as Wi-Fi, GPRS Drivers for modules such as LoRa).

**kernel** ：The TencentOS tiny real-time kernel includes tasks management, real-time scheduling, time management, interrupt management, memory management, exception handling, software timers, linked lists, message queues, semaphores, mutex locks, event flags, and more.

**IoT protocol stack**：TencentOS tiny provides lwip, AT Adapter, SAL layer, supports different network hardware, such as Ethernet, serial Wi-Fi, GPRS, NB-IoT, 4G and other communication modules. A commonly used IoT protocol stack, such as CoAP and MQTT, is provided on the TCP/IP network protocol stack to support the terminal service to quickly access Tencent Cloud.

**Security framework**：TencentOS tiny provides a complete security solution to ensure data transmission security and device authentication security for IoT terminals. The DTLS and TLS security protocols provided by the security framework reinforce the transport layer of COAP and MQTT to ensure that the IoT terminal implements secure authentication and data encryption when docking Tencent Cloud. In addition, for the low-resource terminal hardware, the security framework also provides Tencent. The key authentication scheme of the cloud IoTHub ensures that resource-constrained devices can also achieve device security certification to a certain extent.

**Component framework**：TencentOS tiny provides a series of components such as file system, KV storage, ad hoc network, JS engine, low-power framework, device framework, OTA, and debugging toolchain for users to choose according to business scenarios.

**Open API (in planning and development)**：TencentOS tiny will provide open API functions on the protocol middleware and framework layer, which is convenient for users to call the middleware function, so that users do not need to pay much attention to the implementation of middleware, quickly connect to Tencent cloud, realize the cloud demand on the terminal business, and expect the maximum degree. Reduce the development cycle of the terminal IoT product and save development costs.

**examples**：TencentOS tiny provides sample code, module test code, etc., which is convenient for users to refer to.
